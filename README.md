# InfixToPostFixConverter

This project was my third project for my Data Structures class.
It is a Windows Forms Application that takes an infix expression and converts it to postfix notation. 

There is a text file in the project that gives examples of how it works. 

In this project, I gained a lot of experience with the Stack class in C#. By following a certain algorithm and
using the stack class, the program converts Infix expressions to PostFix.
