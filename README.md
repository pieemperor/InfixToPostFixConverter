# InfixToPostFixConverter

This project is a Windows Forms Application that takes an infix expression and converts it to postfix notation. 

There is a text file in the project that gives examples of how it works. 

In this project, I gained a lot of experience with the Stack class in C#. By following a certain algorithm and
using the stack class, I converted the Infix expression to PostFix.
